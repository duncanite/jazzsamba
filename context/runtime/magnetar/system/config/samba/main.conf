  # not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself.  However, this

  # This tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
  # that connects

  # XXX @dbdbdp

  # Append syslog@1 if you want important messages to be sent to syslog too.

  ####### Authentication #######

  # Server role. Defines in which mode Samba will operate. Possible
  # values are "standalone server", "member server", "classic primary
  # domain controller", "classic backup domain controller", "active
  # directory domain controller".
  #
  # Most people will want "standalone server" or "member server".
  # Running as "active directory domain controller" will require first
  # running "samba-tool domain provision" to wipe databases and create a
  # new domain.
  server role = standalone server

  # XXX @dbdbdp

  # XXX @dbdbdp

  # This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to sync the Unix
  # password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
  # passdb is changed.
  # XXX @dbdbdp

  # XXX @dbdbdp

  # For Unix password sync to work on a Debian GNU/Linux system, the following
  # parameters must be set (thanks to Ian Kahan <<kahan@informatik.tu-muenchen.de> for
  # sending the correct chat script for the passwd program in Debian Sarge).
  # XXX @dbdbdp
  #   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
  #   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .
  # XXX @dbdbdp

  # This boolean controls whether PAM will be used for password changes
  # when requested by an SMB client instead of the program listed in
  # 'passwd program'. The default is 'no'.
  # XXX @dbdbdp
  pam password change = no
  # XXX @dbdbdp

  # This option controls how unsuccessful authentication attempts are mapped
  # to anonymous connections
