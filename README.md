## Run


```bash
docker run -d --rm \
        --name samba \
        --env MOD_MDNS_NAME=samba \
        --env MOD_MDNS_HOST=TimeSamba \
        --env USERS=dubo-dubon-duponey \
        --env PASSWORDS=replace_me \
        --read-only \
        --net host \
        --user root \
        --cap-drop ALL \
        --cap-add DAC_OVERRIDE \
        --cap-add FOWNER \
        --cap-add NET_BIND_SERVICE \
        --cap-add CHOWN \
        --cap-add SETUID \
        --cap-add SETGID \
        --volume [host_path]:/media/home \
        --volume [host_path]:/media/share \
        --volume [host_path]:/media/timemachine \
        docker.io/dubodubonduponey/samba
```

## Notes

### Networking

You need to run this in `host` or `mac(or ip)vlan` networking (because of mDNS).

### Configuration

The following extra environment variables lets you further configure the image behavior:

* MOD_MDNS_HOST controls the host part under which the service is being announced (eg: $MOD_MDNS_HOST.local)
  * If set empty, will disable mDNS announcements altogether
* MOD_MDNS_NAME controls the fancy name
* USERS is a space separated list of users
* PASSWORDS is a space separated list of passwords

The image runs read-only, but the following volumes are mounted rw:
* /etc this is necessary to allow for on-the-fly user creation
* /magnetar/user/data/home where users homes are located
* /magnetar/user/data/share where the common share is located
* /magnetar/user/data/timemachine where the timemachine backups are located
* /magnetar/cache
* /magnetar/state
* /magnetar/runtime

Samba is started with -c /magnetar/system/config/samba/main.conf

You may evidently mount this file to further control samba configuration and behavior.

### Advanced configuration

Any additional arguments when running the image will get fed to the `samba` binary.

## Debugging TimeMachine

From a mac:

```
log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.TimeMachine"' --info | grep 'upd: (' | cut -c 1-19,140-999
```
